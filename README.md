What makes Sunderedcore different
- Agency-first design: The system emphasizes meaningful choices that influence outcomes in real time. Players aren’t locked into rigid class funnels; they shape scenes by spending resources, taking risks, and narrating consequences that the rules honor.
- Fast play: Short turns, clear rules, and an efficient resolution loop keep the action moving. The aim is to resolve scenes with impact in under an hour, then pivot to the next high-stakes moment.
- Open, creator-friendly: The project ships with a creator license and a robust SRD so you can build, publish, and remix content without getting bogged down in gatekeeping or licensing hurdles.
- Flexible settings: The design supports both fantasy and sci-fi flavors, with tools to convert movement, combat, and advancement systems across genres.
- Rich but lean mechanics: Core systems provide depth where it matters (tension, momentum, and social leverage) without bogging you down in bookkeeping.

Quick start guide
1) Gather the crew and choose a vibe. Decide if you’re playing in a fantasy realm, a science-fantasy landscape, or a pure sci-fi setting. The system is built to bend without breaking, so start with a setting and a problem that’s exciting to everyone.
2) Create quick, high-contrast characters. Use concise concepts that name a goal, a flaw, and a single signature move. You don’t need a long sheet to start; you’ll add details as scenes demand.
3) Define the problem in a single scene. The GM (or the group, if you’re playing with a collaborative GM) sets a high-stakes situation, such as a city under siege, a starship on a fuse, or a portal that’s about to tear the fabric of reality.
4) Resolve using the core mechanic. Roll the chosen dice, apply your character’s traits, and use momentum to tilt outcomes toward dramatic results.
5) Move through scenes quickly. When a scene ends, note what matters most for the next moment and don’t belabor the setup. The system rewards momentum and decisive action.
6) Use SRD and quickstart for reference. The SRD gives you rules and options for extending play; the quickstart delivers a ready-to-run scaffold you can drop into a session.
7) When you’re ready to share content, consult the creator license. It clarifies what you can publish and how attribution works, while keeping the door open for community contributions.
8) Check the releases page for assets. The releases page hosts downloadable builds. Each release includes a file you should download and execute to try the latest version locally. For the latest build, visit the releases page now: https://github.com/DARKKin99/sunderedcore/releases

Core mechanics at a glance
- Resolution system: The core mechanic emphasizes a simple roll with meaningful modifiers. Players roll a pool that reflects their approach, add a relevant trait, and compare the result to a target number set by the scene. Success means you move the story forward in a way that matches your intent; a failure creates a complication for later, heightening tension.
- Action economy: Each scene offers a limited number of action opportunities. Players spend actions to attempt tasks, push the situation forward, or call on a signature move that reflects their character’s identity.
- Signature moves: Each character has one or more signature moves that grant extra leverage in key moments. These moves are powerful but come with a cost or risk to preserve balance and tension.
- Momentum and momentum triggers: Momentum is a resource that accumulates when players perform bold actions, take risks, or push the scene toward a dramatic outcome. It can be spent to enhance rolls, access special outcomes, or trigger narrative effects that shape the story.
- Renown as narrative currency: Renown tracks how the group’s actions shape the world. Gaining renown unlocks new narrative options, faction leverage, or unique opportunities that reflect a rising presence within the setting.
- Social mechanics: Social actions are supported by clear mechanics that reward clever, well-timed dialogue and social maneuvering. Influence over scenes and outcomes can rest with players who plan their lines and align them with the story’s stakes.

Character creation and advancement
- Concept first: Start with a simple concept that communicates your goal in the world. Think in terms of what you want to achieve, the obstacle you face, and the unique angle you bring to the party.
- Core traits: Choose a small set of core traits that govern how you interact with the world. Traits are compact and modular, allowing you to blend disciplines and order of operations without heavy bookkeeping.
- Skills and tools: Pick a few skills that fit your concept. Tools and gear are secondary yet useful, providing situational bonuses and flavor.
- Signature moves: Draft a signature move that captures your character’s voice. This move becomes a recurring engine in high-stakes moments.
- Advancement mindset: Advancement is tied to scenes and milestones rather than a fixed XP track. Your progress grows as your choices affect the world, your enemies, and the story’s direction.
- Roles and archetypes: While you can customize freely, archetype ideas help new players get started quickly. For example:
  - The Harbinger: Master of information and social leverage; excels at turning rumors into leverage.
  - The Warden: Triggers battlefield control and protective maneuvers; keeps allies safe while inviting risk.
  - The Relic-Engineer: Combines craft with improvisation; turns wreckage into tools and weapons.
  - The Veilwalker: Uses misdirection and timing; opens or closes routes at the right moment.
- Playstyle variety: The system supports frontline heroes, stealth operatives, scholars, and wild magic users. The core rules are neutral enough to allow hybrids and unusual concepts.

Playing the game: actions, turns, and resolution
- Scene structure: A scene is a focused moment in the story where characters pursue a goal under pressure. It ends when the main objective is achieved, fails, or when a compelling cliffhanger emerges.
- Turn order: Each scene uses a simple turn order that prioritizes agency. Players declare intent, describe their approach, attempt a resolution roll, and reveal the results. The GM sets the stakes and adjusts the scene in response.
- Resolution steps: After a roll, the result informs the scene’s outcome in a direct way. A success may push the protagonists forward; a failure creates a complication that invites creative problem-solving.
- Complications and twists: If a roll fails, the narrative door remains open. The GM introduces a complication that raises the stakes and invites players to adapt their plans.
- Assists and teamwork: Players can assist each other. Assists grant small bonuses and create opportunities for narrative payoffs.
- Handling failure: Failures are not dead ends. They act as fuel for drama and character growth, offering chances to explain new capabilities, alliances, or plot twists.

Momentum, renown, and tension
- Momentum mechanics: Momentum is earned by bold choices and turning the tide in scenes. It’s a flexible resource that can boost a roll, unlock a narrative payoff, or enable a dramatic twist.
- Spending momentum: You can spend momentum to improve the outcome of a roll, influence the environment, or gain short-term advantages in combat or social maneuvers.
- Renown mechanics: Renown tracks the party’s standing in the world. As renown grows, players gain access to unique options, powerful allies, or favorable conditions that reflect their growing influence.
- Tension management: Tension is a constant element of play. The system encourages players to lean into high-stakes moments while maintaining pace, so sessions remain dynamic and engaging.

Stress and strain: emotional and narrative weight
- Stress track: Characters accumulate stress when they face traumatic events, betrayals, or moral compromises. Stress is a narrative fuel, but it also carries risk.
- Consequences of high stress: If stress reaches critical thresholds, characters may suffer temporary penalties or emotional consequences that affect decisions and dialogue.
- Strain and resilience: The game rewards resilience and strategic withdrawal when appropriate. Characters can spend resources or make temporary compromises to reduce strain and keep focus on the scene’s core objective.
- Calibrating intensity: The system supports both humanitarian drama and raw, brutal clashes. You can tune the tone by adjusting how often scenes push characters toward stress and how quickly momentum or renown shifts the balance of power.

Open licenses, SRD, and creator rights
- Open license principles: Sunderedcore is designed to be openly usable with clear attribution guidelines. The license supports fan content, official extensions, and third-party published material.
- System Reference Document (SRD): The SRD is a comprehensive reference that codifies the core rules, vocabulary, and mechanics. It’s designed to be readable by players and publishers alike, enabling reliable conversions and crossovers.
- Creator rights: The Creator License gives you permission to publish derivative content, add new materials, and share your work with the community. It outlines what you can and cannot claim as your own, and how to attribute the original system.
- Content boundaries: The license delineates safe zones for compatibility and cross-compatibility, enabling content that stays true to the system’s spirit while inviting creative experimentation.
- Attribution and sharing: When you publish content built on Sunderedcore, you should credit the original system and provide references to the SRD. This ensures transparency and helps players discover the base rules.

Source conversion and movement conversion
- Source conversion: The system includes guidelines for converting content from other rulesets. Whether you’re mapping classes, abilities, or resources, the conversion is designed to be intuitive and reversible.
- Movement conversion: Movement and spatial mechanics can be tailored to fit a setting. The base framework supports a wide range of tactical choices without demanding a grid or miniatures. If you’re coming from a grid-based system, you’ll find straightforward heuristics to translate distances and actions into Sunderedcore terms.
- D&D 5e and beyond: The design supports cross-genre adaptation. It’s possible to port ideas from D&D and similar systems through modular rules that preserve balance while amplifying narrative agency.
- Practical examples: The SRD contains worked examples of converting weapon proficiencies, abilities, and resource costs. These examples serve as templates for your own homebrew content.

SRD and quickstart
- System Reference Document: The SRD is intended as a practical guide for players, GMs, and creators. It contains core terminology, roll results, and the relationship between momentum, renown, and scene outcomes.
- Quickstart guide: The quickstart distills the core rules into a compact, ready-to-play package. It’s ideal for first sessions, demonstrations, or teaching new players the feel of Sunderedcore without overwhelming them with full rules.
- Play examples: The quickstart includes sample scenes that demonstrate how to structure encounters, how momentum shifts scenes, and how to resolve outcomes in a way that preserves pace and drama.

Open source tooling and assets
- Public assets: The project ships with templates, example character sheets, and starter encounters. These assets are crafted to be drop-in templates for playtests and early sessions.
- Tools for publishers: The SRD and creator license are designed to be friendly to independent publishers. The license clarifies what you can publish and how to attribute the system when you reuse or remix content.

Design notes and philosophy
- Clarity first: The rules aim for clarity and ease of use. If a rule feels complicated, there’s likely a simpler alternative that preserves the feeling of the moment.
- Narrative power: The system is built to reward players for telling bold stories. Mechanics amplify dramatic moments rather than getting in the way.
- Modularity: The SRD is modular. You can drop in new options, swap out sub-systems, or replace certain mechanics with ones you prefer, all while keeping core balance intact.
- Accessibility: The system strives to be accessible to players of different backgrounds. Core concepts are explained in plain language, with examples to illustrate complex moments.
- Balance through play: The design emphasizes play testing. Balance is achieved through iterative testing, not a single grand rule.

Play style and tone
- Scenes driven by stakes: Each scene pushes toward a clear objective with real consequences.
- Tone control: The system supports a spectrum from heroic fantasy to gritty sci-fi noir. You can calibrate tension, danger, and triumph to fit the mood.
- Inclusive storytelling: The design invites diverse voices and perspectives. The world adapts to players’ choices, not the other way around.
- Pragmatic fantasy: The system favors practical, believable fantasy and science fiction. Rules support big ideas without becoming preachy or abstract.

Example play scenario (illustrative, not prescriptive)
- Premise: A ruined city bathed in neon rain holds a hidden data archive that someone is willing to kill for.
- Players: A courier with a trait for speed, a technomancer who can glimpse weak points in systems, and a negotiator who thrives on turning threats into partnerships.
- Scene arc: The team must enter the archive chamber, bypass a security protocol, and extract a clue that points to a nameless traitor.
- Momentum moves: As the team discusses approaches, they roll to gauge the environment, leveraging momentum to trigger alarms, disable traps, or open alternative routes. A successful momentum fetch opens a new route through a maintenance tunnel that the players hadn’t considered.
- Outcome: The environment shifts to reveal a personal betrayal. Renown begins to spread as news of the team’s daring action leaks to factions within the city.
